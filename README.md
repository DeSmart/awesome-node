# Awesome Node

### Frameworks
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - easy to start with. [Express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) will create a scaffolding of your app.

### ORM
- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) - introduces models and migrations but takes time to learn and understand.

### Express
- [Error handling](https://derickbailey.com/2014/09/06/proper-error-handling-in-expressjs-route-handlers/)

### Express + Sequelize
- [Beginner's guide](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/10/22/node-postgres-sequelize/) - outdated (2015), but has several valuable insights.
- [Getting started](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-express-and-postgres-using-sequelize) - nice tutorial in which you bundle-up everything, step by step (plus [source code](https://github.com/waiyaki/postgres-express-node-tutorial)).
- [Model configuration](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/models-definition/#configuration) - this can be tricky and frustrating.

### Packages
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) - bcrypt hasher implementation, useful for password hashing
- [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) - JWT authorization toolset
- [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) - input validation
- [node-uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) - UUID generation

### Development
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - live-reload for node.js

### Resources
- [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott) - he wrote **a lot** of valuable articles on medium.com (mainly regarding JS, but still very, very useful)
